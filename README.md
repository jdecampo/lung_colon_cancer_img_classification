# Lung Colon cancer histopathological imgages Classification - Project Overview
Lung and Colon cancer histopathological image classification utilizing DeepL (CNN, Transfer Learning) as part of Deep Learning course assignment.
- The objective of the course assignment was to assess to what extent applying different Deep Learning techniques, specifically computer vision (CNN, Transfer Learning),
deviates the predictive outcomes of detecting and diagnosing lung and colon cancer based on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset ![image](https://github.com/jdecampo/lung_colon_cancer_img_classification/assets/165015942/b175065f-41d1-4522-87dc-d6907201d8de)
